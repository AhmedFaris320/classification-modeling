## 🔍 Project Overview  
This repository provides a structured pipeline to load, preprocess, analyze, visualise and model a dataset for a binary classification task  It includes modules for:  
- Loading data from CSV files  
- Inspecting & summarising the dataset  
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features  
- Visualising univariate and bivariate relationships  
- Training and comparing three baseline models: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Evaluating model performance, selecting the best model<br>
## ✅ Why Use This Pipeline?  
- Modular structure: separate classes for loading, preprocessing, analysis, visualisation, modelling.  
- Easy to reuse: swap out the CSV file path, target variable, or add new models.  
- Clean baseline: the code uses standard tools (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`) so you can build upon it for further experiments.  
- Good for educational/experimental use: see how preprocessing steps affect model performance, compare algorithm behaviour, visualise data.
